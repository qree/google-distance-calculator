3. Now place the [[MK-GDC latitude="default map latitude" longitude="default map longitude" ] shortcode on the post/page where you want the MK Google Distance Calculator to appear. The first parameter will be the latitude and the second will be the longitude of the default Google Map which will appear when the page first loads.
